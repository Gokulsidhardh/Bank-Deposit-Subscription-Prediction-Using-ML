# Bank-Deposit-Subscription-Prediction-Using-ML

The prediction of bank deposit subscriptions is a critical task in the financial industry, aimed at identifying potential customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict customer behavior based on various attributes, including demographic information, account details, and previous marketing interactions. By employing a range of data preprocessing steps, feature selection, and classification algorithms, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately classify customers into those who will subscribe to a term deposit and those who will not. The insights gained from this analysis can help banks optimize their marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and ultimately increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their campaigns.
